username
    Required. 30 characters or fewer. Alphanumeric characters only (letters, digits and underscores).

first_name
    Optional. 30 characters or fewer.

last_name
    Optional. 30 characters or fewer.

email
    Optional. E-mail address.

password
    Required. A hash of, and metadata about, the password. (Django doesn’t store the raw password.) Raw passwords can be arbitrarily long and can contain any character. See the “Passwords” section below.

is_staff
    Boolean. Designates whether this user can access the admin site.

is_active

    Boolean. Designates whether this user account should be considered active. Set this flag to False instead of deleting accounts.

    This doesn’t control whether or not the user can log in. Nothing in the authentication path checks the is_active flag, so if you want to reject a login based on is_active being False, it is up to you to check that in your own login view. However, permission checking using the methods like has_perm() does check this flag and will always return False for inactive users.

is_superuser
    Boolean. Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.

last_login
    A datetime of the user’s last login. Is set to the current date/time by default.

date_joined
    A datetime designating when the account was created. Is set to the current date/time by default when the account is created.
