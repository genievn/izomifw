In addition to those automatic API methods, User objects have the following custom methods:

is_anonymous()
    Always returns False. This is a way of differentiating User and AnonymousUser objects. Generally, you should prefer using is_authenticated() to this method.

is_authenticated()
    Always returns True. This is a way to tell if the user has been authenticated. This does not imply any permissions, and doesn't check if the user is active - it only indicates that the user has provided a valid username and password.

get_full_name()
    Returns the first_name plus the last_name, with a space in between.

set_password(raw_password)
    Sets the user's password to the given raw string, taking care of the password hashing. Doesn't save the User object.

check_password(raw_password)
    Returns True if the given raw string is the correct password for the user. (This takes care of the password hashing in making the comparison.)

set_unusable_password()
    New in Django 1.0.

    Marks the user as having no password set. This isn't the same as having a blank string for a password. check_password() for this user will never return True. Doesn't save the User object.

    You may need this if authentication for your application takes place against an existing external source such as an LDAP directory.

has_usable_password()
    New in Django 1.0.

    Returns False if set_unusable_password() has been called for this user.

get_group_permissions()
    Returns a list of permission strings that the user has, through his/her groups.

get_all_permissions()
    Returns a list of permission strings that the user has, both through group and user permissions.

has_perm(perm)
    Returns True if the user has the specified permission, where perm is in the format "package.codename". If the user is inactive, this method will always return False.

has_perms(perm_list)
    Returns True if the user has each of the specified permissions, where each perm is in the format "package.codename". If the user is inactive, this method will always return False.

has_module_perms(package_name)
    Returns True if the user has any permissions in the given package (the Django app label). If the user is inactive, this method will always return False.

get_and_delete_messages()
    Returns a list of Message objects in the user's queue and deletes the messages from the queue.

email_user(subject, message, from_email=None)
    Sends an e-mail to the user. If from_email is None, Django uses the DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL.

get_profile()
    Returns a site-specific profile for this user. Raises django.contrib.auth.models.SiteProfileNotAvailable if the current site doesn't allow profiles. For information on how to define a site-specific user profile, see the section on storing additional user information below.
    
    
Manager functions

class models.UserManager

    The User model has a custom manager that has the following helper functions:

    create_user(username, email, password=None)

        Creates, saves and returns a User. The username, email and password are set as given, and the User gets is_active=True.

        If no password is provided, set_unusable_password() will be called.

        See Creating users for example usage.

    make_random_password(length=10, allowed_chars='abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789')
        Returns a random password with the given length and given string of allowed characters. (Note that the default value of allowed_chars doesn't contain letters that can cause user confusion, including 1, I and 0).
